React.js Assignment 1:

You need to develop a clone application. The app is based on spending $100,000,000,000 of Bill Gates' money on imaginary products.


Initially, a balance of $100,000,000,000 should be defined.

Each time a purchase of any product is made, Gates' balance must decrease.

Whenever any product is sold, Gates' balance must increase.

If no product has been purchased, the "Sell" button should not be active.

If the price of any product is higher than the balance, the "Buy" button should not be active.

Purchased products should be listed at the bottom of the screen with their quantity and total cost.![Screenshot 2024-02-06 172357](https://github.com/halecosar/Hafta-22/assets/142445977/aef103ff-381d-462d-9fcc-ceb5c29c0b51)
